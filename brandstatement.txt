Brand Statement Alex Esch

Hello, 
	My name is Alex Esch. I am a full stack web developer. I attended University of Richmond's bootcamp. 
I am proficient in : html, css, bootstrap, javascript, jqueries, node.js, and several other coding toolsets/ languages.
Since birth, my father was a software engineer, and knows over 7 languages. Coding has always persisted where I have lived.
I particularly enjoy coding in html, css, javascript, and jqueries. I am seeking a full stack web development job, and would be
excited, and open to learning new languages, and developing things outside of the web as well.
Outside of coding, I enjoy video games, and the outdoors. I hope one day i could contribute code to developing a video game.
